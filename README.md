# Note-Taker
Application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes.

## Description
This project was created to fine-tune my newly learned skills using node.js and ES6+. The objective of the project was to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a PDF profile from a GitHub username. The application will be invoked with the following command: node index.js. The user will be prompted for their GitHub username as well as their favorite color. The app will then generate a html file and a pdf file with the user's GitHub information and favorite color set to the background. This project was difficult simply because it was very new material so it took me awhile to get used to the syntax and flow of things. Overall, I enjoyed creating something new and testing my skills in a whole new facet of web development.

## Usage
1. Open the index.js file, open the terminal and "cd" into the correct directory.

2. Once inside the correct directory, install the required NPM installations using "npm install".

3. Invoke the following command within the terminal to get the app to run (node index).

4. The user will be prompted to enter their GitHub username and their favorite color.

5. The app will run and create an HTML file first, followed by a converted version of the file, a PDF.

6. The PDF will contain all the required GitHub user info as well as a background set to the color specified by the user.
